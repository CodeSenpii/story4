<d>a <span data-content="g low">glow</span> <span data-content="o' ver">over</span> the <span data-content="ho' ri' zon">horizon</span>. It was <span data-content="st ill">still</span> <span data-content="d ark">dark</span> outsid</d>

<d id="p1">the world. The emerging glow looked like somethin</d>

<d class='up2'>was set ablaze in the distance. I could not see s</d>
<d>flames or smoke just a small but very noticeable </d>
<d>that interrupted the darkness in the distance. Th</d>
<d id="p2">distant light was made up of many colorsâ€™ red, or</d>

<d class='up3'>yellow and a tinge of blue where it met the sky. </d>
<d>light stretches a great distance across the expan</d>
<d>finally fading back into darkness at the furthest</d>
<d  id="p3">The most intense light came from the center of th</d>

<d class='up4'>blaze which was straight ahead me. As I gazed upo</d>
<d>this phenomenon minute by minute it grew brighter</d>
<d>and brighter, reaching up even further into the s</d>
<d id="p4">Replacing the darkness and outing the stars close</d>

<d class='up5'>its edges.  Then I saw it, peeping over the curve</d>
<d>of the earth like a curious spectator peering ove</d>
<d>fence; It was the source of the great light. The </d>
<d id="p5">were all gone at this point; hidden away behind t</d>




<d class='up6'>morning sky. All the creature of the air began to</d>
<d>almost in unison at the coming of the new day. As</d>
<d>minutes tick by the curious spectator swelled to </d>
<d id="p6">round, bright ball of light. No longer being able</d>

<d class='up7'>directly at the fierce circle of light I turned m</d>
<d>towards hit. I could feel a gentle warming effect</d>
<d>evading my body starting from the back of my neck</d>
<d id="p7">spreading to my shoulders and down my back.  The</d>

<d class='up8'>warmth comforted me and made me feel alive. What</d>
<d>is this creature? is it a dragon? Is it a great v</d>
<d>erupting behind me? What can be so bright that it</d>
<d id="p8">share its light and heat with the entire world? W</d>

<d class='up9'>can give life to a wilted flower? What can so eas</d>
<d>usurp the night and make the stars flee behind</d>
<d>the deep blue sky? I turned again to face this si</d>
<d id="p9">usurper with my hand over my eyes. A warm</d>

<d class='up10'>sensation filled my face.  Sliding my hand slowly</d>
<d>away I opened my eye and I saw it, only for a mom</d>
<d id="p10">as my vision was overwhelmed by its radiance. </d>
